## Problem

- Data breaches in critical sectors such as insurance, healthcare, and finance.  
- People lose control over their personal information.  
- Example: Data leaks after accidents or security incidents.

## Solution

**IDShield**: Sovereign digital identity.  

- Data stored in a private vault.  
- The user decides who accesses, when, and what information is shared.  
- Use of ZK (Zero-Knowledge) proofs to validate attributes without exposing sensitive data.
